# Clean calendar #
A small tooolbox to obtain a calendar from a source, clean it and publish it. 

** Work in progress **

# Idea:
 1. A source object is used to retrieve a calendars content as an instance of a Calendar object.
 2. A cleaner takes a Calendar object as input and returns a modified Calendar object.
 3. A publisher takes an Calendar object and publishes it. 

## Working: 

 * I can't remember

## Planned:

 1. source

	Calendars can be retrieved with the following sources:
	* `source.ical` - Loads an `.ical` file
	* `sources.google`
	
 * source.google
 * source.exchange
 * cleaner.cleaner
 * publisher.publisher
